# How is it to be human?


This repository contains the work undertaken during my bachelor's thesis at the Socially Assistive Robotics with Artificial Intelligence (SARAI) research group, KIT.

The main contribution of my thesis is a dialogue system, managing conversations between humans and PixelBot, a social robot. This was achieved by integrating GPT-3.5 with PixelBot and designing a suitable prompt.
